bcut - binary cut

Output a number of bytes from a given offset in a file.

I needed to output a few thousand bytes at offset 0x38576800 within a 20GB
file, and I figured all existing tiny tools I had at hand had different
shortcomings or bottlenecks.

Note that offset and length can be given as hex if you prefix with 0x.

Output is sent to stdout, redirect at will.
